// How to avoid defining same methods in all classes?   Ans: define the re-usable methods in a library class
// What all the ways to call/use the methods defined in library class?
// 1. By creating object of another class   (most recommendation way)
// 2. By using static keyword in methods declaration of the another class (less recommend way)
// 3. By using inheritance concept (least recommend way)
